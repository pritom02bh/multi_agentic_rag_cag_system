      "response": "# Current Tariffs on Imports from China\n\n### Current Status\n- The current US tariff on imports from China is set at **34%**. This tariff is part of a broader trade policy affecting various sectors, including consumer electronics and other goods. However, specific exemptions apply to technology products like iPhones and PCs ([Web 1], [Web 2]).\n\n### Impact on Products\n- **Pharmaceutical Products**: The context does not specify if the pharmaceutical items listed are directly affected by the tariffs. Typically, pharmaceuticals might be exempt or subject to different tariff rates, but this would require confirmation from specific trade regulations or company import records.\n- **Inventory Items**: The items listed in the inventory data (e.g., Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, etc.) are not explicitly mentioned in the web search results as being affected by the tariffs. However, if any raw materials or components used in these products are imported from China, they could be subject to the tariff.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Verify Product Classification**: Check the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes for each pharmaceutical product to determine if they fall under the tariff categories.\n- **Review Supply Chain**: Assess the supply chain to identify any components or raw materials sourced from China that might be impacted by the tariff.\n- **Consult Trade Experts**: Engage with trade compliance experts to ensure all regulatory requirements are met and to explore potential tariff mitigation strategies.\n- **Monitor Policy Changes**: Stay updated on any changes in trade policies or exemptions that might affect the import of pharmaceutical products from China.",

      "response": "# Current Tariffs on Imports from China\n\n## Current Status\n- **Tariff Rate**: The tariffs on Chinese goods can range from **7.5% to 100%** depending on the product category ([Web 2](https://example.com)).\n- **Specific Tariff for Pharmaceuticals**: There is no specific mention of pharmaceuticals in the provided web search results, indicating that the current focus of tariffs might be on other categories like technology and consumer goods ([Web 1](https://example.com), [Web 4](https://example.com)).\n\n## Impact on Products\n- **Pharmaceutical Inventory**: Based on the inventory data provided, there is no direct indication that the listed pharmaceutical items such as Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Atorvastatin, etc., are currently affected by the tariffs on Chinese imports.\n- **Potential Indirect Effects**: If any raw materials or components used in the manufacturing of these pharmaceuticals are sourced from China, they might be subject to tariffs, potentially increasing production costs.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Monitor Tariff Announcements**: Stay updated with any changes in tariff policies that might include pharmaceuticals in the future.\n- **Evaluate Supply Chain**: Assess the supply chain for any raw materials or components sourced from China that could be impacted by tariffs.\n- **Cost Analysis**: Conduct a cost analysis to determine if any indirect costs might arise from tariffs on related goods or materials.\n- **Alternative Sourcing**: Consider identifying alternative suppliers outside of China to mitigate potential tariff impacts on raw materials.\n\nBy maintaining vigilance on tariff developments and proactively managing supply chain risks, the potential impact on pharmaceutical inventory can be minimized.",
