      "response": "# Current Tariffs on Imports from China\n\n## Current Status\n- The US has imposed tariffs on a broad range of products imported from China. These tariffs are part of ongoing trade tensions and have been subject to changes and exemptions over time.\n- As of the latest updates, certain technology products have been exempted from these tariffs, but other sectors, including pharmaceuticals, may still be affected ([Web 1], [Web 2]).\n\n## Impact on Products\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: While specific details on pharmaceutical tariffs are not fully detailed in the provided web search results, it is known that tariffs can impact the cost of raw materials and finished products imported from China.\n- **Inventory Items**: The following items in our inventory could potentially be affected if they involve components or raw materials sourced from China:\n  - **Paracetamol** (Item ID: ITEM -CCEE944C)\n  - **Ibuprofen** (Item ID: ITEM -32C437D9)\n  - **Aspirin** (Item ID: ITEM -00DBC34C)\n  - **Atorvastatin** (Item ID: ITEM -CC350352)\n  - **Lisinopril** (Item ID: ITEM -2AB2ABEF)\n  - **Metformin** (Item ID: ITEM -5E3F6D68)\n  - **Amoxicillin** (Item ID: ITEM -02A72706)\n  - **Ciprofloxacin** (Item ID: ITEM -8F86EF91)\n  - **Sildenafil** (Item ID: ITEM -3AABDB93)\n  - **Albuterol** (Item ID: ITEM -1113DD0E)\n  - **Insulin** (Item ID: ITEM -B2378A41)\n  - **Adalimumab** (Item ID: ITEM -B14B42DE)\n  - **Rituximab** (Item ID: ITEM -262D39D9)\n  - **Erythropoietin** (Item ID: ITEM -16BA9109)\n  - **Growth Hormone** (Item ID: ITEM -8AFEBE46)\n  - **Flu Vaccine** (Item ID: ITEM -5AEDFB62)\n  - **Hydrocortisone** (Item ID: ITEM -3A00619E)\n  - **Alpha Interferon** (Item ID: ITEM -A184D581)\n  - **Beta Interferon** (Item ID: ITEM -7B5DECC3)\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Review Supply Chain**: Assess the supply chain for each product to determine if any components or raw materials are sourced from China. This will help identify which items are directly impacted by tariffs.\n- **Cost Analysis**: Conduct a cost analysis to understand how tariffs may affect the unit cost of affected products. Adjust pricing strategies accordingly to maintain profitability.\n- **Alternative Sourcing**: Explore alternative suppliers outside of China to mitigate the impact of tariffs on procurement costs.\n- **Monitor Regulatory Changes**: Stay updated on any changes to tariff regulations that may affect pharmaceutical imports. This will help in making timely adjustments to procurement and pricing strategies.\n- **Inventory Management**: Maintain optimal inventory levels, especially for items with longer lead times, to avoid potential supply disruptions due to tariff impacts.",
