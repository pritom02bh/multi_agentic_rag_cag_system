However, continuous monitoring is essential to maintain this status.\n- **Replenishment Strategy:** The reorder point is set to trigger orders well before stock levels fall to critical levels, ensuring a buffer against unexpected demand spikes or supply chain disruptions.\n\n#### **Recommendations**\n- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous inventory monitoring to ensure stock levels remain above the reorder point and adjust reorder quantities based on demand fluctuations.\n- **Buffer Stock:** Maintain buffer stock to mitigate risks associated with lead time variability and demand surges.\n- **Review and Adjust Reorder Points:** Regularly review and adjust reorder points based on consumption patterns and lead time changes to optimize inventory levels.\n- **Cycle Counts:** Conduct weekly cycle counts for Paracetamol, classified as an A-item, to ensure inventory accuracy and prevent discrepancies.\n\nBy adhering to these practices, the lead time for Paracetamol inventory can be effectively managed to ensure timely replenishment and avoid stockouts.",
