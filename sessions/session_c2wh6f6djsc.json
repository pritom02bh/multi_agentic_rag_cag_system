      "response": "**Current Inventory Turnover Ratio for Erythropoietin (EPO)**\n\nBased on the provided inventory data and the query regarding the inventory turnover ratio for Erythropoietin, let's analyze the information:\n\n1. **Erythropoietin Inventory Data:**\n   - Generic Name: Erythropoietin\n   - Current Stock: 17,211 units\n   - Reorder Point: 5,589.04 units\n   - Manufacturing Date: 02-10-2024\n   - Expiry Date: 02-07-2027\n   - Lead Time: 44 days\n   - Storage Condition: Refrigerated\n   - Unit Cost: $64.81\n   - Selling Price: $16.32\n\n2. **Calculation of Inventory Turnover Ratio for Erythropoietin:**\n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = (Cost of Goods Sold) / (Average Inventory)\n   - Since we don't have the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) directly, we can estimate it by considering the purchases of Erythropoietin during a specific period.\n\n3. **Insights and Recommendations:**\n   - The inventory turnover ratio helps in assessing how efficiently inventory is managed and how quickly products are sold.\n   - A higher turnover ratio indicates efficient inventory management, while a lower ratio may suggest overstocking or slow sales.\n   - To calculate the exact turnover ratio, additional data on purchases and sales of Erythropoietin within a specific timeframe is needed.\n   - If the turnover ratio is low, it may indicate excess inventory or insufficient sales, requiring a review of stocking levels and demand forecasting.\n\n4. **Web Search Insights on Erythropoietin:**\n   - Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production in response to low oxygen levels.\n   - It plays a crucial role in maintaining red blood cell mass and can impact health when levels are imbalanced.\n\nIn conclusion, without specific sales data, the exact inventory turnover ratio for Erythropoietin cannot be determined. Further analysis of sales figures would be necessary to calculate this ratio accurately and evaluate the efficiency of managing Erythropoietin inventory.\n\n**References:**\n\nInventory:\n- [Inventory 1]  \nItem ID: ITEM -CCEE944C  \nBatch Number: P2410 -2...\n- [Inventory 2] tus: Active  \nLast Updated: 11 -02-2025 22:24  \n \n...\n- [Inventory 3] \nExpiry Date: 23 -02-2027  \nLead Time (Days): 16  ...\n- [Inventory 4] ng Price: 106.9  \nManufacturing Date: 03 -10-2024 ...\n- [Inventory 5] ature  \nSpecial Handling: None  \nUnit Cost: 56.36 ...\n",
