      "response": "Based on the provided context information, the current inventory status for pharmaceutical products in the system can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Stock Levels**: The inventory management system automatically tracks medicine stocks to ensure adequate levels are maintained.\n- **Reorder Points**: When a drug falls below a predetermined quantity (reorder point), it is automatically reordered to maintain inventory levels efficiently.\n- **Expiry Dates**: The system likely monitors expiry dates of pharmaceutical products to prevent the dispensing of expired items and ensure product safety and effectiveness.\n\nWhile the exact numerical values for stock levels and reorder points are not specified in the search results, the system seems to operate based on predetermined reorder points to manage inventory effectively.\n\nFor more detailed and specific information, internal inventory records or system reports should be consulted to provide precise stock levels, reorder points, and expiry dates for pharmaceutical products in the system.",
