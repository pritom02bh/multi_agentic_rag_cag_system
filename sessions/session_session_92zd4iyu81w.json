  "enhanced_query": "Please provide an enhanced query for pharmaceutical inventory analysis by incorporating relevant pharmaceutical inventory management concepts and metrics:\n\nQuery: What is the current inventory status in terms of stock levels, expiration dates, and turnover rate for pharmaceutical products?\n\nThis query seeks to understand the current state of the pharmaceutical inventory by considering multiple aspects. It aims to gather information on stock levels, ensuring that the inventory is neither overstocked nor understocked. Additionally, it requests details on expiration dates to identify any products that are nearing or have already expired, which is crucial for maintaining product quality and compliance. Lastly, it inquires about the turnover rate, which measures how quickly products are being sold or used, providing insights into the efficiency of inventory management and potential opportunities for improvement.",
