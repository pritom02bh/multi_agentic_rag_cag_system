      "response": "# Current Tariffs on Imports from China\n\n## Current Status\n- The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on a broad range of products imported from China.\n- The current tariff rate is **34%** on various goods, including electronics and other consumer products.\n- Some technology products like iPhones, PCs, and chips have been exempted from these tariffs.\n\n## Impact on Products\n- The pharmaceutical items listed in the inventory are not specifically mentioned in the web search results as being directly affected by the tariffs.\n- However, if any components or raw materials used in the manufacturing of these pharmaceuticals are sourced from China, they could be subject to the 34% tariff.\n- This could potentially increase the cost of goods sold if the tariffs apply to any part of the supply chain.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Review Supply Chain**: Conduct a thorough review of the supply chain to identify any components or raw materials sourced from China that may be subject to tariffs.\n- **Cost Analysis**: Perform a cost analysis to determine the potential impact of tariffs on the overall cost structure and pricing strategy.\n- **Supplier Diversification**: Consider diversifying suppliers to mitigate risks associated with tariffs and ensure a stable supply chain.\n- **Monitor Regulatory Changes**: Stay updated on any changes in tariff regulations and exemptions that may affect the pharmaceutical industry.\n- **Strategic Inventory Management**: Adjust inventory levels and reorder points to account for potential cost increases and lead time changes due to tariffs.",
