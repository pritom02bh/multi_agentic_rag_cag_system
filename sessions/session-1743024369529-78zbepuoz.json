Critical Items (stock < 5000 units):\n   - Adalimumab, Hydrocortisone, and Alpha Interferon are critical items with stock levels below 5000 units. Immediate attention is required to avoid stockouts and potential revenue loss.\n\n2. Items Needing Attention (stock < reorder point):\n   - Hydrocortisone is a high-risk item with a current stock level of 3,252 units, below the reorder point of 3,616 units. It is recommended to order 26,748 units within the next 3 days to prevent stockouts.\n\n3.

Additionally, monitoring high-value items like Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Metformin, Aspirin, and Lisinopril is recommended for effective inventory management.\n\nPlease let me know if you require any further assistance or clarification.
