This metric helps evaluate the financial impact of the inventory and can assist in decision-making related to inventory management.\n\nBased on the data provided, it is not possible to analyze shipment delays as the context does not include relevant information on shipment dates or expected delivery times.\n\nHowever, based on the available information, some general recommendations for pharmaceutical inventory management include:\n\n1. Regularly review stock levels and reorder points to ensure optimal inventory levels and avoid stockouts.\n2. Prioritize items with low stock levels for reordering to maintain customer satisfaction.\n3. Monitor expiration dates closely and prioritize the sale of items nearing their expiry to avoid wastage and financial losses.\n4. Implement a robust tracking system for shipments to monitor delivery times and identify any potential delays.\n5. Consider implementing safety stock levels for critical items to mitigate the impact of shipment delays or unexpected demand fluctuations.\n6. Regularly review and update storage conditions to ensure product quality and minimize the risk of spoilage or damage.",
