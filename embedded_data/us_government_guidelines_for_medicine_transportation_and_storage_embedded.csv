US Government Guidelines for Medicine Transportation and Storage_page_1,"U.S. Government Guidelines for Medicine Transportation and Storage  
1. Regulatory Framework  
PharmaCo’s shipments of pharmaceutical raw materials (e.g., Growth Hormone , Metformin , Flu Vaccine ) to the 
U.S. (destination: Port of New York and New Jersey, USEWK) are subject to:  
• FDA (21 CFR Parts 210 and 211) : CGMP regulations ensure drugs remain safe and effective during 
transport and storage.  
• FSMA Sanitary Transportation Rule (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart O) : Applies to road and air shipments 
(e.g., Lisinopril  via YRC Freight, Paracetamol  via UPS Airlines), requiring sanitary conditions.  
• PHMSA (49 CFR Parts 171 -180): Governs hazardous materials (e.g., Beta Interferon  in deep freeze 
containers at -80°C to -20°C).  
• TSA : Secures air shipments (e.g., Ibuprofen  via Emirates SkyCargo).  
2. Transportation Guidelines  
2.1 General Requirements  
• Sanitary Conditions : Vehicles must be free of contaminants. For example, Sildenafil  (SHIP -24570857, 
road via Schneider) requires a clean truck to avoid cross -contamination with its plastic drum packaging.  
• Temperature Control : Temperature -sensitive shipments must comply with USP <659> and FDA 
guidance:  
o Refrigerated (REF, 2°C –8°C) : Insulin  (SHIP -07471B71) and Growth Hormone  (SHIP -
68722A1D) use cold chain containers, requiring continuous monitoring and temperature logs 
(included in RequiredDocuments).  
o Frozen (FRZ, -25°C to -18°C) : Flu Vaccine  (SHIP -959D93DF) and COVID -19 Vaccine  (SHIP -
959D93DF) use freezer containers, with dry ice or refrigeration units validated per FDA cold 
chain protocols.  
o Controlled Room Temperature (CRT, 15°C –35°C) : Lisinopril  (SHIP -CDA1A448, 20°C –
35°C) and Metformin  (SHIP -79A92C35, 15°C –25°C) use pallet boxes or cardboard, requiring no 
excursions beyond labeled ranges.  
• Packaging : Per 21 CFR Part 211.94, packaging must protect against damage:  
o Ibuprofen  (SHIP -23649250) uses pallet boxes for air transport (DHL Aviation), ensuring 
stability during turbulence.  
o Beta Interferon  (SHIP -8F55442C) uses cryo boxes for deep freeze ( -25°C to -15°C), meeting 
PHMSA triple -packaging standards for biologics.  
2.2 Hazardous Materials  
• Classification : Biologics like Erythropoietin  (SHIP -C555A8B8) or Alpha Interferon  (SHIP -248C1C90, 
-80°C to -20°C ) may be Category B infectious substances (UN 3373) if diagnostic -grade, requiring 
PHMSA -compliant labeling.  
• Packaging : Beta Interferon  (SHIP -D08D4A2E, deep freeze container) must use triple packaging 
(primary vial, secondary watertight layer, outer rigid box) with UN markings if hazardous.  
• Training : Handlers for Ciprofloxacin  (SHIP -980D2E10, high risk) need DOT hazmat training (49 CFR 
Part 172.704) due to daily inspection requirements.  
2.3 Mode -Specific Rules  
• Air Transport : Shipments like Paracetamol  (SHIP -9D4AFF13, DHL Aviation) and Adalimumab

Government Guidelines for Medicine Transportation and Storage.pdf,pdf,1
US Government Guidelines for Medicine Transportation and Storage_page_2,"o Temperature logs for Growth Hormone  (SHIP -E475DA12, REF -30°C to 30°C) are mandatory.  
o FreightCost ($0.04 for Growth Hormone , SHIP -E475DA12) reflects lightweight IU units, but 
hazmat surcharges may apply if misclassified.  
• Road Transport : Domestic shipments (e.g., Ibuprofen  from San Juan, SHIP -19E67B91, Schneider) and 
cross -border from Canada/Mexico (e.g., Metformin  from Montreal, SHIP -A8096F51, J.B. Hunt) require 
pre-cooled trucks for REF items ( Insulin , SHIP -1BDECA65).  
• Secondary Mode (Road) : Most air shipments (e.g., Albuterol , SHIP -38E7C254) use road for last -mile 
delivery to USEWK, requiring seamless temperature continuity.  
2.4 Documentation  
• Required Documents : Per shipment data, all include Commercial Invoice , Packing List , Certificate of 
Analysis , Insurance Certificate , and Customs Declaration . Temperature -sensitive items (e.g., Flu 
Vaccine , SHIP -0A78295D) add Temperature Log . 
• Compliance : FDA and U.S. Customs Service require prior notice for imports (e.g., Aspirin  from 
Mexico, SHIP -BEA23CC9). Missing logs (e.g., Lisinopril , SHIP -CDA1A448, “None” for temp log) risk 
detention.  
2.5 Security  
• TSA mandates tamper -proof measures for air shipments (e.g., Sildenafil , SHIP -71382CAE). 
TrackingNumber (e.g., FE2502117425085 for Growth Hormone ) ensures traceability, aligning with 
GDP anti -counterfeiting standards.  
3. Storage Guidelines  
3.1 Facility Standards  
• CGMP (21 CFR Part 211.142) : At PharmaCo’s Manufacturing Plant (USEWK), drugs must be stored 
to prevent degradation:  
o Metformin  (SHIP -64A7DEBD, 15°C –25°C) needs CRT shelving.  
o Insulin  (SHIP -07471B71, 2°C –8°C) requires refrigerated units with backup power.  
• Quarantine : Incoming Ciprofloxacin  (SHIP -A76718FA) with “Fair” packaging_integrity 
(QualityMetrics) must be segregated until inspected.  
3.2 Temperature Ranges  
• CRT (20°C –25°C, excursions 15°C –30°C) : Atorvastatin  (SHIP -FE3A0275, 15°C –25°C) aligns with 
USP <659>, but excursions (QualityMetrics: 2) must be documented.  
• Refrigerated (2°C –8°C) : Growth Hormone  (SHIP -182BFCA6) requires cold storage; excursions (0 in 
QualityMetrics) indicate compliance.  
• Frozen ( -25°C to -15°C or -80°C to -20°C) : Beta Interferon  (SHIP -B696B65E, -80°C to -20°C) needs 
ultra-cold freezers, with humidity_deviations (1) flagged for review.  
3.3 Special Handling  
• Cold Chain : Flu Vaccine  (SHIP -0A78295D, -25°C to -18°C) requires validated freezers and transport 
continuity, per FDA’s September 2023 guidance.  
• Hazardous Drugs : Rituximab  (SHIP -88E6EB2F) in small mg quantities needs restricted access per 
OSHA/NIOSH, despite CRT storage.

Government Guidelines for Medicine Transportation and Storage.pdf,pdf,2
US Government Guidelines for Medicine Transportation and Storage_page_3,"• Continuous monitoring is required:  
o Erythropoietin  (SHIP -B50D9982, Continuous MonitoringLevel) uses real -time sensors, with 
QualityMetrics showing 2 excursions for investigation.  
o Amoxicillin  (SHIP -B321281C, Standard MonitoringLevel) needs monthly checks, sufficient for 
CRT.  
3.5 Labeling and Inventory  
• Labels must match TemperatureRange (e.g., Paracetamol , SHIP -018DD47E , “Store at 15°C –25°C”). 
Records (LastUpdated not in shipment data) must track receipt and distribution per 21 CFR Part 
211.184.  
4. Compliance Metrics from Shipment Data  
• Temperature Excursions : Adalimumab  (SHIP -9CC5111E ) has 0 excursions (ideal), while Metformin  
(SHIP -B696B65E) has 3, risking FDA scrutiny unless justified.  
• Packaging Integrity : Ibuprofen  (SHIP -4FEF4EC3, Excellent) meets standards; Lisinopril  (SHIP -
F41C9477, Fair) requires repackaging if damaged.  
• Documentation Completeness : Atorvastatin  (SHIP -5D6EF7C0, 0.9992) is near -perfect; Albuterol  
(SHIP -2FC1F480, 0.9514) risks delays if below 0.95 threshold.  
5. Enforcement and Penalties  
• Inspections : FDA audits USEWK for CGMP compliance; PHMSA checks Beta Interferon  (SHIP -
922D84E0) for hazmat adherence.  
• Penalties : Paracetamol  (SHIP -646FBF03) with 3 excursions and “Fair” packaging could face seizure or 
fines under FD&C Act if potency is compromised.  
• Training : Staff handling Insulin  (SHIP -1BDECA65, REF) need CGMP and cold chain training (21 
CFR Part 211.25).

7. Recommendations for PharmaCo

US Government Guidelines for Medicine Transportation and Storage_page_4,"• Documentation : Add temperature logs to Sildenafil  (SHIP -BEC04A5E) to meet FDA import rules, 
despite CRT stability.  
• Packaging : Replace “Fair” integrity (e.g., Ciprofloxacin , SHIP -29DBAD3A) with sturdier options to 
reduce risk during air transport.
