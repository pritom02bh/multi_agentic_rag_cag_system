Inventory Management Policy_page_1,"Inventory Management Policy  
1. Objective  
This policy provides guidelines for efficient inventory management to ensure product availability, minimize holding costs, 
prevent obsolescence, and meet business demands based on the dataset (dated March 11, 2025). It aligns with avoiding 
stockouts, reducing costs, improving cash flow, enhancing customer satisfaction, and enabling scalability, per OptiLogic’s 
“5 Important Reasons to Define Your Inventory Policies” (Jan 27, 2025).  
2. Inventory Classification  
Inventory is classified using ABC analysis based on value and turnover frequency: - A-items : High -value, critical items 
requiring stringent monitoring. - B-items : Moderate -value items with steady demand. - C-items : Low -value, high -
turnover items suited for bulk storage.  
3. Stock Types  
Stock categories informed by the dataset: - Raw Materials : APIs and excipients (assumed inputs for manufacturing). - 
Finished Goods : Packaged medicines. - MRO Supplies : Equipment like refrigeration units.  
4. Service Level Targets  
Service levels balance investment and demand: - A-items : 98%. - B-items : 95%. - C-items : 90%.  
5. Safety Stock Levels  
Safety stock mitigates risks, calculated from dataset metrics: - Paracetamol : 10% of monthly demand. - Growth 
Hormone : 15% due to refrigeration needs. - Hydrocortisone : Below reorder point, flagged for action.  
6. Replenishment Policies  
Strategies optimize stock levels: - Reorder Point : Trigger at dataset -defined points. - Min/Max : Restock to 
MaxInventory. - Days of Supply : Based on lead time and usage.  
7. Lead Time Management  
Lead time tracking prevents delays: - Average Lead Time : ~27 days. - Mitigation : Buffer stock for >30 -day lead times.  
8. Inventory Accuracy  
Ensure precision: - Cycle Counts : Weekly (A -items), monthly (B -items), quarterly (C -items). - Record Updates : Use 
LastUpdated (2025 -02-11 22:24:02) as a baseline.  
9. Storage and Handling  
Maintain quality: - Temperature Control : Refrigerated (2°C –8°C) or Room Temperature. - Special Handling : Protocols 
for temperature -sensitive items.  
10. Performance Metrics  
KPIs track efficiency: - Inventory Turnover Ratio : Measures stock movement. - Fill Rate : Target >95% for A -items. - 
Stockout Rate : Monitor shortages.  
11. Continuous Improvement  
Regular reviews and technology (e.g., AI forecasting) optimize policies.
